We will be having the annual Yeast Wranglers Christmas party at [Craft Beer Market](https://goo.gl/maps/39SuRgcNgtD2) this year. It will be Wednesday December 6th at 8pm.

There will be ales and lagers, and also food and much merriment. 

We will be featuring our own Secret Santa that we like to call __Drunk Santa__. 

The Drunk Santa details are:

1. __Bring a bottle of beer__ that you would be happy to receive (no joke gifts please).  
2. __Make sure it's wrapped__ (funny pages accepted).  
3. __Homebrew is welcome__ and encouraged, but give some details about the brew please - a random brown bottle becomes much tastier when we have an idea what we are drinking.
4. If you __bring a bottle__, you will be __taking home a bottle__ someone else has wrapped. 

__Please note:__ 

1. this is a member only meeting, no drop-ins.
2. As this is a bar, we cannot bring outside beer to share.
