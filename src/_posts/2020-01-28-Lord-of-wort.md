Do you want to taste what the other brewers have entered into the Lord of the Wort competition?  This is the meeting for you!

We will be holding a fan favourite vote with some sweet prizes!  Come down and pick the brains of your fellow yeast wranglers and find out how they put their own spin on Haze Lord.  Challengers -- don't forget to bring approximately 2-3L of your beer.
