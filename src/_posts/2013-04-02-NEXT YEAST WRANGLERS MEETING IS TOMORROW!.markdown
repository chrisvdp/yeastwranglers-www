<p>Sorry for the late notice&#44; but the <strong>next CTYW meeting will be held tomorrow&#44; April 3&#44;</strong> at the Wild Rose Brewery and Taproom (I think y'all know the address - if not&#44; click the WR link).&nbsp;</p><p>More <strong>SOUR BEER</strong> for you sour lovers out there - you know who you are. Lovely Belgian sourness. All sour all the time. Oh...sour never tasted so good. Particularly with <strong>CHEESE</strong>. Puckering (and presentation) starts at 8:00 pm!</p>
