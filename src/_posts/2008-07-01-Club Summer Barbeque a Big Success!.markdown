"<p>On Saturday&#44; June 28th&#44; the club held its first annual summer barbeque.&nbsp; Special thanks to Fezz and his wife Rebecca for hosting such a wonderful event!&nbsp; We had more than 30 people in attendance (and enough beer for twice that!)&#44; and everyone was treated to lots of sunshine&#44; great food&#44; some fierce Bocce ball competition&#44; lots of comraderie&#44; and plenty of homebrew.&nbsp; Extra thanks to Rebecca for preparing our bbq-roasted beef dinner&#44; which was a special treat because it came from a local organic producer that uses feed from Wild Rose grains.&nbsp; Thanks to everyone who contributed appetizers&#44; snacks&#44; side-dishes&#44; and homebrew to the event!</p>"
