<hr>

For the second year in a row, the Yeast Wranglers, and Malcolm MacKenzie, our Alberta Rep on the Canadian Homebrewers Association will be hosting a virtual brew day.  Details are as follows:

### Details

**When:** Saturday June 5th, starting at 10am.

**What:** Set up your webcam, brew a beer, share your setup, thoughts on brewing, and whatever else is on your mind.  People from around the country will be invited to attend.

**Where:** On the Candian Homebrewers Association Discord: [https://discord.gg/D6mXBv5kc8](https://discord.gg/D6mXBv5kc8) (Further details and video links will be posted here).

**Why:** Brew whatever you want, or grab a kit of our grain and brew an awesome tropical stout with your own twist.  Also: two other official recipes provided by prominent Canadian Homebrew influencers.

**Who:** General homebrewing public is welcome, and a membership to the Canadian Homebrewers Association is not required.

### Bribes / Incentives

As a thank-you to our club, the CHA is offering all Yeast Wrangler Members a 50% discount on membership.  Use code "CYW21" on signup at:
[https://canadahomebrews.ca/membership/](https://canadahomebrews.ca/membership/)

**Free(ish) Grain!** - For those Yeast Wrangler members agreeing to join in on the virtual brew day, some the grain needed for a five gallon batch of will be packaged and distributed from the Vineyard at the same time as the summer advent swap.  Depending on the number of signups, the price for a kit may vary -- we're hoping to cover at least half the cost.  A limited supply of "Dragon" tropical stout will be distributed, courtesy of Malcolm, with each grain bag, for inspiration and calibration.

**Bragging Rights:** A competition of homebrew day tropical stouts will be arranged some point in the late summer.  (perhaps in conjunction with a bbq, covid permitting).

### Recipe

**Grain bill will be based on the following recipe:**

[https://beerandbrewing.com/recipe-bent-brewstillery-fi-dem-jamaican-style-stout/](https://beerandbrewing.com/recipe-bent-brewstillery-fi-dem-jamaican-style-stout/) by BJCP grandmaster judge, director, and educator Dr. Kris England.

Yeast, hops, and sugar adjuncts will be up to each participant to provide  Recommend yeast is a warm fermented lager, but Kveik, english, or beligan yeasts might all be effective alternatives.  The magic of a tropical stout comes from the choice of sugars, and this is perhaps a great segue for applying some of Shawn's wisdom and thoughts on candi sugar.  (or to use up that bottle of dark maple syrup that's been haunting your pantry!).

**More Recipes:**

The CHA has also posted an "official" tropical stout recipe, by Niagra College's Victor North. This is a great alternative to the suggested recipe and uses some really cool specialty malt (special X and carafa III).

A second official beer recipe, a catalina wine mixer, has been also posted by perennial brewer of the year threat, Cory Day:
