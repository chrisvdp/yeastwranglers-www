### Announcements (Darryl)
1. Agenda overview - Announcements, activities, Ed has some competition updates, Malcolm will do a presentation on the updated 2021 BJCP guidelines and some competition entry advice.  Online socializing will move over to Discord.
2. Passes - 2022 memberships are being sent out.  Passes are for the calendar year.  So if you intended to purchase a 2022 pass, but paid at the very end of 2021, send an email to info@yeastwranglers.ca
  - Passes are for the calendar year.  If you purchased a pass late last year in December, it was automatically considered a 2022 membership.
3. Website review & sponsor review
4. Our annual Holiday Social (drinks, food, Secret Drunk Santa) has been postponed.  We will let folks know what happens here -- whether we can slide it to February, or do a wrapped beer swap in a parking lot.
5. New members

### Competitions (Ed)

  - Winter advent went really well (thanks Matt for organizing).  Voting for prizes is open until the 11th.
