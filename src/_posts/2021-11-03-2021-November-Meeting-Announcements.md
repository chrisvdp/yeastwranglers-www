### Announcements (Darryl)
1. Agenda overview - Announcements, activities, Ed has some competition updates, Brian Maude will give a presentation on brewing with Calgary water, then Commercial beer tasting to occur afterward on Google meet.  General socializing will move over to Discord.
2. Passes - All new memberships and membership renewals submitted up until noon today have been emailed out. If you didn’t receive the pass, send an email to info@yeastwranglers.ca.
  - Passes are for the calendar year.  So if you intended to purchase a 2022 pass, but paid recently, send an email to info@yeastwranglers.ca -- that said, you need to be a paid member to vote in the AGM.
3. AGM will be Wednesday November 24th at 8PM.
  - Need 20-ish folks to attend
  - If you want to nominate for any position, email Kevin at secretary@yeastwranglers.ca
  - If you just want to volunteer some time to help, email Darryl at info@yeastwranglers.ca.  We always have lots of stuff that needs doing (reaching out for sponsorships, picking up prizes, sorting prizes, mailing prizes, helping with the website, helping with memberships, etc.).
4. In-person meetings are still up in the air.  Will make the call on a month by month basis.  We will try to give folks a week's notice.
