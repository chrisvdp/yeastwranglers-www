The Cowtown Yeast Wranglers homebrew club is proud to present: <a href='http://yeastwranglers.brewcompetition.com/' target='_blank'>The 15th Annual 2023 Homebrew Roundup!</a>

We welcome entries of beer, mead, and cider from home brewers across Canada.

If you’re looking to get some quality feedback from trained BJCP judges on how to improve your brews or if you’ve got your eyes set on a new medal for the display cabinet, you can <a href='http://yeastwranglers.brewcompetition.com/' target='_blank'>sign up here</a>. Judging will be based on the <a href='https://www.bjcp.org/stylecenter.php'>2021 BJCP style guidelines</a>.

Registration opens up on the 21st of January and will close on the 16th of February. As with previous years, the bottle drop off /shipping location is The Vineyard. Bottles can be dropped off from the 4th of February to the 17th of February. If you’re eligible to judge (BJCP accredited judges, cicerones, and professional brewers only) or want to help out as a steward during the judging, [please register here](https://yeastwranglers.brewcompetition.com/index.php?section=volunteers).

After all the judging is complete and the winner has been chosen, the competition will be wrapped up with an in-person awards ceremony, being held on Saturday, March 4th. More details to follow.

This competition is only successful because of hard work from a bunch of awesome volunteers. If you want to help this year, but don’t know how, please <a href='mailto:malcolm@yeastwranglers.ca'>contact the competition organizer</a>. Malcolm can also answer any other questions you may have regarding the competition.
