"<p>Mark your calendars!&nbsp; The first annual Cowtown Yeast WRanglers summer barbeque will be held on Saturday&#44; June 28th.&nbsp; We hope all club members and their families can join us for an afternoon of fun and comraderie (and beer!).&nbsp; The club will supply the main course&#44; and we encourage anyone who is interested to bring a salad&#44; side dish&#44; or dessert to contribute to our feast.&nbsp; And of course&#44; feel free to bring some homebrew to share!&nbsp; There will also be some fantastic door-prizes and give-aways.&nbsp; <a href="/LinkClick.aspx?link=315&amp;tabid=171">Read more and sign up here...</a></p>"
