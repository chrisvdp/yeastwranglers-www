We will be having the annual Yeast Wranglers Christmas party at [Tool Shed Brewery](https://goo.gl/maps/TuUJmfqAPNQ2) this year.
The fine folks at the Brewery have agreed to make us a cask for the event, and also have food and much merriment. 

We will be featuring our own Secret Santa that we like to call __Drunk Santa__. 

The Drunk Santa details are:

1. __Bring a bottle of beer__ that you would be happy to receive (no joke gifts please).  
2. __Make sure it's wrapped__ (funny pages accepted).  
3. __Homebrew is welcome__ and encouraged, but give some details about the brew please - a random brown bottle becomes much tastier when we have an idea what we are drinking.
4. If you __bring a bottle__, you will be __taking home a bottle__ someone else has wrapped. 

__Please note:__ 

1. this is a member only meeting, no drop-ins.
2. As this is a brewery, we cannot bring outside beer to share.
