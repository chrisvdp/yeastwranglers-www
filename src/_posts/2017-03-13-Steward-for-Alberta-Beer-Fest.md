Time to start thinking about Calgary International Beer Festival on May 5th and 6th. If you would like to be involved from the inside there are openings for beer stewards to assist in the competition that takes place during the Beer Festival. As steward, you will be in charge of getting beer for a specific judging group. You will steward one day of the event and be invited to judge/attend the other day of the event (May 5th & 6th).
