We&rsquo;re taking our annual Homebrew Roundup Gala Dinner up a notch this year and holding it at The National Beer Hall on 8<sup>th</sup>.

We&rsquo;re still working out some of the finer details&#44; but can tell you now that __tickets will be only $50__ for an amazing four-course meal (possibly with beer pairings not only suggested&#44; but supplied &ndash; that&rsquo;s one of the details being working on!).

If you&rsquo;ve patronized any of the National locations&#44; you know this is a great spot for beer lovers&#44; with over 40 craft beers on tap and absolutely delicious&#44; inspired food coming from the kitchen.

__So save the date: Saturday&#44; February 27&#44; 2016__

Tickets on sale Feb 3rd @ 6pm
