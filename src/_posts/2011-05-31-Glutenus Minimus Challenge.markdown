"<p>We have had a great response to our gluten-free brewing competition&#44; and we will begin distributing the containers of sorghum syrup at the Yeast WRanglers meeting tomorrow night.&#160;If you would like to pick up some yeast slurry as well&#44; we will do so at the same time.&#160;The yeast will be handed out in Ziploc bags; if you are more comfortable transporting a hard container&#44; feel free to bring a sanitized&#44; sealed container with you to hold the slurry. If you have signed up for a brewing kit but are not able to attend the meeting&#44; your syrup will be available at the Vineyard (South location) later this week.&#160;If you need to pick up yeast slurry&#44; you need to make special arrangements with Dave Neilly.</p>"
