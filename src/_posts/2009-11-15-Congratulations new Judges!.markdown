"<p>Congratulations to our 13 new BJCP beer judges that wrote the gruelling 3 hour BJCP Exam yesterday.&nbsp; Each participant spent more than 2 months taking classes about beer evaluation&#44; technical aspects of brewing&#44; and world beer styles.&nbsp; It will be a few months until the exams are graded and the examinees know their judge rank in the BJCP Program&#44; but each one is now officially a member and apprentice beer judge for having completed the course and the exam.&nbsp; Congratulations to all who participated&#44; and special thanks go out to Wild Rose Brewery for graciously providing the venue for the classes and the exam!</p>"
