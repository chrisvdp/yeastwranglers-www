In these pandemic times, the traditional CTYW barbecue is a hot mess of the not-delicious kind we usually see at this event. Clearly, we can’t gather or share food and homebrew as usual. But is there something we can do to help members safely scratch that itch of wanting to socialize, share some homebrew and geek out?
 
The challenges are many, so before we go too far down the rabbit hole of what’s possible and what’s not, the executive would like to gauge our membership’s interest in and limits for some kind of gathering or gatherings. Please help out by taking a few minutes to respond to this survey.
