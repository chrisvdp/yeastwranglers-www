**Meeting Details**

Date: May 6th, 2020

Location: **[WebEx](http://www.yeastwranglers.ca/events/Yeast-Wranglers-In-The-Age-of-Covid.html)**

Time: **8pm**

For the May meeting, the club is going to try something new; Digital Meetings. Since this is new to all of us there will be a learning curve but we hope to keep it all as simple as possible. A monthly club meeting tends to have 3 parts:

1. Announcements
   * What's new with the club
2. Presentation
3. Social
    * Having 100 people on a virtual meeting chat isn't going to work.
    * Typically, people break into smaller groups and chat.

To facilitate the different parts of a meeting we have done some research on possible tech solutions.

The first two parts can be done via WebEx. We looked at a few solutions and the WebEx free tier allows for unlimited meeting length and should fit everyone who wants to attend (100 max).

The social aspect is a little harder while we all social distance.

We have been playing with a Yeast Wranglers discord server (you can join now by going to https://discord.gg/zK9svhq). Discord is a community-focused chat application that is used widely in the gaming community. It's free to use and has web and native clients, so you can try it out without having to install anything. It has text and audio based chat capabilities that we think should allow us to have some resemblance to the social part of club meetings (sadly, without the homebrew sharing). The discord server is always active, but we expect the most activity after club meetings.

As always we would love to hear your positive and negative feedback on our plan. If you have experience in holding digital meetings and think there is some aspect of this that won't work, or there is some platform that would work better, please reach out via email yeastwranglers@chrisvdp.com or leave a comment in discord.
