Registration for the [2015 Cowtown Roundup](http://www.yeastwranglers.ca/Competitions/Roundup15/tabid/432/Default.aspx) is now open. For the uninitiated, the Roundup is the 7th annual homebrew competition put on by the Yeast WRanglers. It's a great opportunity to get an unbiased opinion on your beer and how you can improve it. There is also the chance to win great prizes and, more importantly, big shiny medals

If you have never entered or been a part of a homebrew competition, or are thinking about doing the BJCP certification, stewarding is a great initiation. Spend a few nights talking and drinking beer while seeing a competition in action. What could be better? You can [sign up here](http://yeastwranglers.brewcompetition.com/register).
