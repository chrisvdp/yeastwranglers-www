<p>It is Learn To Homebrew Day today November 2&#44; 2013. Many of the club members will be over at The Vineyard in the back parking lot brewing up a storm and teaching anyone interested in homebrewing. We even have the Brewers from Tool Shed Brewing doing up a batch of Stout. 2014 Memberships will be on sale as will Tees and Glasses </p>
