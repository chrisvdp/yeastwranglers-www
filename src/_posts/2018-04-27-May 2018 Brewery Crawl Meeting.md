excerpt: Who's excited for a Brewery Crawl?
---

For our May 2nd, 2018 meeting we are trying something a little different. We are going to do a brewery crawl along the newly minted <a href='https://twitter.com/hashtag/brewmudatriangle?src=hash' target="_blank">#brewmudatriangle</a>

We will start at:

* **Tool Shed at 6pm**
* **Common Crown at 7pm** (*they are opening just for us* ðŸ˜˜ðŸ™Œ)
* **Red Bison at 8pm**

People can go to ToolShed anytime *(they open at noon!)* and Red Bison will stay open until they get sick of us- at least 10 pm if we require it. 

**Marlborough LRT is about an 8-minute walk due east for those who don't want to drive.**

Red Bison has a good food selection (paninis), although the others will let us order anything in if people want.
