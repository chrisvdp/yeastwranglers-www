<p>The October meeting will be something new: Gear Night!&#160; Home brewers are notoriously frugal and inventive and create all kinds of cheap (and sometimes not so cheap) inventions to solve problems in brewing.&#160; Bring in things you are particularly proud of to showcase this spirit.&#160; This will be an informal night to chat with other home brewers about their gear.&#160; This isn't limited to home-made inventions - "bling" you have purchased is fine too...</p>
