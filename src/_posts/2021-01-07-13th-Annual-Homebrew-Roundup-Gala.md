The Cowtown Yeast Wranglers homebrew club is proud to present: <a href='http://yeastwranglers.brewcompetition.com/' target='_blank'>The 13th Annual 2021 Homebrew Roundup!</a>

We welcome entries of beer, mead, and cider from home brewers across Canada.

Judging will be based on the <a href='https://www.bjcp.org/stylecenter.php'>2015 BJCP style guidelines</a>.

Registration opens up on the 14th of January and will close on the 14th of February. As with previous years, the bottle drop off /shipping location is The Vineyard. Bottles can be dropped off from the 1st of February to the 14th of February. If you’re eligible to judge (BJCP accredited judges, cicerones, and professional brewers only) or want to help out as a steward during the judging, [please register here](https://yeastwranglers.brewcompetition.com/index.php?section=volunteers).

Judging will be taking place online over virtual tasting sessions. [More information on the competition website](http://yeastwranglers.brewcompetition.com/). After all the judging is complete and the winner has been chosen, the competition will be wrapped up with a virtual awards ceremony, being held on Saturday, February 27. More details to follow.
