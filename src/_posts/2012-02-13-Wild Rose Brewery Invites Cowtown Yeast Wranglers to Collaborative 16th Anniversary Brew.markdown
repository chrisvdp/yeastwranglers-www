<p><img width="80" height="57" align="left" alt="" src="/CYW/Images/logo_Wild Rose Brewery.gif" />Our favourite brewery and long-time club supporter&#44; Wild Rose Brewery&#44; recently revealed that it will be teaming up with some lucky club brewers to craft their 16th Anniversary seasonal release. The Cowtown Yeast Wranglers are honoured to be invited to collaborate on the anniversary brew. Brewery&#160;General Manager Jamie Vadori says&#44; "There are&#160;many craft beer enthusiasts in our community who we've wanted to collaborate with. Our goal for this&#160;brew is to bring creative minds together and craft a special beer to celebrate 16 years of innovation at Wild&#160;Rose Brewery." Jamie&#44; we couldn't be more tickled to be a part of this! More details to be released to club members very soon -- watch our website or Twitter feed for details.</p>
