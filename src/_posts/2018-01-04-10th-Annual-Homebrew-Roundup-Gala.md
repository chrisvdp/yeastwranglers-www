The Cowtown Yeast Wranglers homebrew club is proud to present: <a href='http://yeastwranglers.brewcompetition.com/' target='_blank'>The 10th annual 2018 Homebrew Roundup!</a> That’s right, we’ve been at this for 10 awesome years!

We welcome entries of beer, mead, and cider from home brewers across Canada.

Whether you’re new to home brewing and are looking to get some constructive advice from trained BJCP judges on how to make your beer better, or if you’re experienced and are taking a crack at some medals and prizes, be sure to visit our 2018 competition page to read up on the rules, and register. Judging is going to be based on the <a href='https://www.bjcp.org/stylecenter.php'>2015 BJCP style guidelines</a>.

We’re accepting registration starting January 3rd until February 21st. Bottle drop off / shipping location is The Vineyard only, and the entry timeline is from January 17th to February 21st. If you’re eligible to judge (BJCP accredited judges and professional brewers only) or want to help out as a steward during the judging, <a href='http://yeastwranglers.brewcompetition.com/index.php?section=volunteers' target='_blank'>please register via the competition page</a>. 

Judging will be taking place at the <a href='http://www.yeastwranglers.ca/monthly%20meetings/Getting-to-and-Parking-at-Canyon-Glen.html'>Canyon Glen Condominium Rec Center</a>. <a href='http://yeastwranglers.brewcompetition.com/' target='_blank'>More information on the competition website</a>.

Don’t quote us on this, but they may or may not be prizes for best-named beer, so be sure to keep things fun and creative!

The event will culminate with the spectacular awards banquet which is being held at National on 8th on Saturday, March 3rd, 2018. 

This competition is only successful because of hard work from a gregarious bunch of awesome volunteers. If you want to help this year, but don’t know how, <a href='mailto:Mike.foniok@gmail.com'>please contact the competition organizer</a>. Mike is also open to answering general questions about the competition so don’t hesitate! 

Good luck to all, and Happy Brew Year!
