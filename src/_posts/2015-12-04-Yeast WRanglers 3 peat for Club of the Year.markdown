<p>Our competition club brewers have done it again!!! For the third straight year Cowtown Yeast Wranglers have managed to eak out a win as Canada's top Homebrew Club. It was a &nbsp;marathon year with maybe even too many competitions but our brewers held up strong and several of them entered each and every of the 15 competitions on the slate. The loss of package of beer on the way to one of the competitions made it look like we might not garner top spot and it was only the final event of the year that we were able to grab the top spot on the podium. Congratulations go out to all the fine brewers across this country that participated and to Jared Carlberg for winning Brewer of the year.</p>
