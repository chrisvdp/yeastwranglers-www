### Announcements (Darryl)
1. Agenda overview - Announcements, competition updates, Natasha from Establishment here to give a presentation on beer and food pairings, Q&A, then Commercial beer tasting to occur afterward on Google meet.  General socializing will move over to Discord.
2. Discord - Lots of activity (which I love), but a quick tip for those who want to keep notifications low.  You can mute the entire Yeast Wranglers server, or individual channels.  Click the bell icon for options.
3. Instagram - We have one @yeastwranglers -- thanks to Fallon for running it.  If you post your brew days, make sure to tag us.
4. Passes - All new memberships and membership renewals submitted up until noon today have been emailed out.  If you didn't receive the pass, send an email to info@yeastwranglers.ca.  Check the back for discount information.
5. Next meeting -- tentatively scheduled to have New Level give a talk on fruiting beers.  New Level LOTW2 signup is in email (drop off carboy before Jan 10, pickup Jan 11 or 12, if you want to participate in the New Level side of the competition, drop off at New Level at the end of February).  There's a bit of time from this meeting until the LOTW2 drop off deadline.

### Competitions (Ed)
1. 2020 Homebrew Club of the Year (Yeast Wranglers) and Brewer of the Year (Paul Heslop)
2. We may have a club competition for LOTW2 participants -- possibly late Feb or early March.  Not confirmed yet.  Folks can certainly use the Homebrew swap group for feedback on their beers.
3. Porter club competition - Drop off 2 bottles at the Vineyard by Jan 29.  Label bottles with name, phone, email, BJCP style, and additional info if required (fruit, spices, etc.).
