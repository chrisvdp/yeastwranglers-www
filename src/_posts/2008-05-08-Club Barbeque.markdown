"<p>Mark your calendars!&nbsp; The first annual Cowtown Yeast WRanglers summer barbeque will be held on Saturday&#44; June 28th.&nbsp; We hope all club members and their families can join us for an afternoon of fun and comraderie (and beer!).&nbsp; The club will supply the main course&#44; and we encourage anyone who is interested to bring a salad&#44; side dish&#44; or dessert to contribute to our feast.&nbsp; And of course&#44; feel free to bring some homebrew to share!&nbsp; There will also be some fantastic door-prizes and give-aways.&nbsp; Stay tuned to the website or club newsletter for more details and a sign-up list.</p>"
