After a week of judging some amazing homebrews from right across Canada, filling out hundreds of score sheets, and chewing on way too many palate-cleansing crackers, we wrap it all up with our spectacular *Roundup Awards Gala!*

We’ll be at *National on 8th* again this year where chef Justin Labossiere will stuff us with a 4-course dinner, including beer pairings. If last year is an indication, you might wanna wear your “buffet pants”….just sayin’.

The evening will be punctuated with draws for awesome beery door prizes from our generous sponsors and *AWARDS!*

Who made a gold medal winning IPA this year? Who grabbed Best of Show? Who won the coveted Yeast Wrangler of the Year title? Who will have the most medals clinking around their neck? Could it be you? *Come to the Gala and find out!*

This is the best night 50 bucks can buy, and there are only 70 tickets available. Don’t delay! Get your tickets now!
