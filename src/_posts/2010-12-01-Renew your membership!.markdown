"<p>It's that time of year again -- time to renew your club membership for the 2011 calendar year.&#160; Annual club dues are $30 for individuals and $50 for couples.&#160; A membership form and full details can be found on our membership page <a target="_self" href="http://www.yeastwranglers.ca/About/Membership/tabid/287/Default.aspx">here</a>.&#160; Just bring a completed form and payment (cheque or exact cash please!) to the next club meeting to renew&#44; or drop by The Vineyard (south location) and talk to Neil.</p>"
