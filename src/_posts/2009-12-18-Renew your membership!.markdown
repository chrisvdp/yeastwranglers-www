"<p>Club membership renewals for the 2010 calendar year are now being sold at a cost of $30.&#160; Please see club treasurer Neil Bamford before or after the next club meeting to purchase your new membership. Online forms for new or renewing members can be found <a href="/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=qZ2%2b%2fn9WeLo%3d&amp;tabid=171" target="_blank">here</a>. If you have already paid for your 2010 membership&#44; you can pick up your new membership card from Neil at the next club meeting&#44; or if you want it sooner&#44; just drop by The Vineyard's south location and pick up your card there.</p>"
