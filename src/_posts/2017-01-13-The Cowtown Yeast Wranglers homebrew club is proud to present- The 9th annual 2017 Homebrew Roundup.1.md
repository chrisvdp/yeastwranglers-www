The Cowtown Yeast Wranglers homebrew club is proud to present: The 9th annual 2017 Homebrew Roundup!

We welcome entries of beer, mead, and cider from home brewers across Canada!

Whether you’re new to home brewing and are looking to get some constructive advice from a trained BJCP judge on how to make your beer better, or if you’re experienced and are taking a crack as some medals and prizes, be sure to visit our 2017 competition page to read up on how to read the rules, and register. Judging is going to be based on the 2015 BJCP style guidelines.

We’re accepting registration starting February 1st until March 15th. Bottle drop off / shipping location is The Vineyard only, and the entry time line is from February 15th to March 15th. If you’re eligible to judge (BJCP accredited judges and professional brewers only) or want to help out as a steward during the judging, please register via the [competition page](http://yeastwranglers.brewcompetition.com/). 

Judging will be taking place at the Canyon Glen Condominium Rec Center. More information on the competition website.

Don’t quote us on this, but they may or may not be prizes for best-named beer, steward’s favourite, etc. So be sure to keep things fun and creative!

The event will culminate with the spectacular awards banquet which is being held at [National on 8th](http://ntnl.ca/national-on-8th/home-ntnl8) on April 1st, 2017. 

Please contact [Mike.foniok@gmail.com](mailto:Mike.foniok@gmail.com?subject=What up my dude? I got a question about the Roundup) with any questions.
