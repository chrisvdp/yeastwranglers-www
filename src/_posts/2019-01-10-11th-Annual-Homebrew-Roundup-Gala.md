The Cowtown Yeast Wranglers homebrew club is proud to present: <a href='http://yeastwranglers.brewcompetition.com/' target='_blank'>The 11th Annual 2019 Homebrew Roundup!</a>

We welcome entries of beer, mead, and cider from home brewers across Canada.

If you’re looking to get some quality feedback from trained BJCP judges on how to improve your brews or if you’ve got your eyes set on a new medal for the display cabinet, you can <a href='http://yeastwranglers.brewcompetition.com/' target='_blank'>sign up here</a>. Judging will be based on the <a href='https://www.bjcp.org/stylecenter.php'>2015 BJCP style guidelines</a>.

Registration opens up on the 14th of January and will close on the 19th of February. As with previous years, the bottle drop off /shipping location is The Vineyard. Bottles can be dropped off from the 19th of January to the 19th of February. If you’re eligible to judge (BJCP accredited judges and professional brewers only) or want to help out as a steward during the judging, [please register here](https://yeastwranglers.brewcompetition.com/index.php?section=volunteers).

Judging will be taking place at the <a href='http://www.yeastwranglers.ca/monthly%20meetings/Getting-to-and-Parking-at-Canyon-Glen.html'>Canyon Glen Condominium Rec Center</a>. <a href='http://yeastwranglers.brewcompetition.com/' target='_blank'>More information on the competition website</a>.
After all the judging is complete and the winner has been chosen, the competition will be wrapped up with the awards banquet, being held on Saturday, March 2nd. More info will follow on the time/location.

This competition is only successful because of hard work from a gregarious bunch of awesome volunteers.
