This event keeps getting better each year. This year the party was held at Brian Read's. Neil Bamford and Corey Clayton provided a vast array of smoked meats cheeses jerky and beer. Many of the attendees brought a vast array of delicious homebrew and Brewsters&nbsp; even sent over a keg of limited edition Cascade hopped IPA. Thanks to Corey's walless tent and Brians huge patio umbrella even the rain passed by without slowing down the celebration.
