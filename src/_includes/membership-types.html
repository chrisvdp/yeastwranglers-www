        Memberships are good for the calendar year and allow you to attend all club meetings without paying a drop-in fee.  Annual members will also have their shipping charges subsidized if the member submits entries in a club-sanctioned brewing competition.  Annual members may also <a href="/membership/sponsors/" target="_blank">receive discounts at selected merchants</a>.</p>
      </p>
      <p>
        Drop-in memberships are also available to attend individual club meetings.  Your first meeting is free, then each drop-in afterwards is $10.  Annual members are not required to pay drop-in fees.
